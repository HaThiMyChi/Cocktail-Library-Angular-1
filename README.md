# CocktailWebApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## About
Imagine you're at a friend's house, having a good time and thinking about making yourself a cocktail. You're bored of the old vodka and juice drinks and want something more interesting - plus you want to impress your friends. All you have to do is open the "My Bar" app on your phone and choose one of the drinks you yorself put there, so you know it's gonna be good.

The ideea for this app came to me when, for my bithday in 2022, my friends made me a collection of cocktails, each adding their favorite mixed drink. They also made a fun game where I had to guess who's cocktail was who's. Because I love mixed drinks, be they alcoholic or non-alcoholic, being able to store the recipes somewhere and look them up whenever is very useful to me.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. It will automatically open the browser to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run server` to have access to the json database and be able to use the website's CRUD functionalities.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
